## Repository Role

This repository serves as the **GitHub-native entrypoint** for my work.
It indexes and routes to canonical protocol specifications, production
indexing artifacts, and structural analysis systems.

The portfolio site at https://whmatrix.github.io serves a **separate role**
as an external narrative and client-facing surface.

## Start Here

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **[Universal Protocol v4.23](https://github.com/whmatrix/universal-protocol-v4.23)** | Canonical spec: deliverable contracts, audit contracts, quality gates |
| **[semantic-indexing-batch-02](https://github.com/whmatrix/semantic-indexing-batch-02)** | Production implementation: 8.3M+ vectors indexed |

> Note: [semantic-indexing-batch-01](https://github.com/whmatrix/semantic-indexing-batch-01) is a superseded foundation batch.

## Structural Analysis Projects

- https://github.com/whmatrix/interaction-mechanics-index — Behavior-first retrieval system for human–AI dialogue segments using dual FAISS indices
- https://github.com/whmatrix/comparative-grammar-gpt-vs-claude — Structural crosswalk between GPT and Claude interaction grammars
- https://github.com/whmatrix/structural-collaboration-primitives — Interaction primitive definitions derived from validated dialogue typologies
